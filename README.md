## Reflection
JavaScript is hard! This week I learned about something that ails almost 60% of all developers from juniors to the most senior level: Impostor's Syndrome. 

In case you are unware, Impostor's Syndrome is a condition where one feels as if they are not quailified even though they have the same skills and accolades as colleagues and fellow students.

Despite doing very well in this course thus far, I fell into this syndrome this week for the first time. The entire week I stressed myself out and felt very unproductive and inferior not knowing this is something that almost everyone in this field experiences. I also learned this has made a large amount of people quit and put out work that is short in quailty. 

I am a firm believer in talking about mental health and simply just having it open to discussion will help developers drastically and make the field an overall better place for everyone.
